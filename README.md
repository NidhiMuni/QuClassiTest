# QuClassi: A Hybrid Deep Neural Network Architecture based on Quantum State Fidelity 
## MLSys 2022 Publication

QuClassi is a Quantum Deep Neural Network architecture for classification, based on quantum state fidelity 

## Usage

To use QuClassi, install the requirements by using 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Within main.py, there is a subsampling section
```python
SUBSAMPLE = 1000
````
This is to be edited according to computational constraints. More data results in slower training speeds, and hence subsamples are used for quicker evaluation.
