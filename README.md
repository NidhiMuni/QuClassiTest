Testing basis encoding, amplitude encoding, and rotation encoding in QuClassi. 

For comprehensive final results, see [amplitude encoding (best explained)](/quclassi_amp_errormit_hardware.ipynb), [basis encoding](/quclassi_basis_errormit_hardware.ipynb), and [rotation encoding](/quclassi_rotation_errormit_hardware.ipynb). This includes tests on the simulator, a simulator of the noise model from IBM_Torino, and IBM_Torino, including and excluding error mitigation.

I initally ran tests on the simulator and any possible IBM quantum computers. To see results, see [here](/quclassi_amp_hardware.ipynb), [here](/quclassi_basis_hardware.ipynb), and [here](/quclassi_rotation_hardware.ipynb). These quantum computers did not achieve high accuracies. Because of these bad results, I decided to try error mitigation. 

The poster for presentation I gave at PNNL's intern symposium before I had my error mitigation results: [here](/Munikote_QE_Poster.pdf).
